# Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The client, The Gaming Room, wanted a web-based version of their game "Draw It or Lose It," currently available on Android.  They needed support for multiple teams and players, unique names for games and teams, and a singleton pattern to ensure only one instance of the game is active at a time.  The software design aimed for cross-platform compatibility (web, mobile, desktop) while addressing scalability, performance, security, and maintainability.

# What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  Provided informed recommendations for technology choices and implementation strategies, demonstrating a thorough understanding of potential solutions to meet project goals.

# What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  Working through a design document before coding provides a solid foundation, minimizes uncertainties, and enhances the efficiency and effectiveness of the development process.  I found it to be completely helpful.

# If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  If I were to revise one part of the work on these documents, I would focus on enhancing the System Architecture View section.  Specifically, I would aim to provide a more detailed description of the physical components or tiers of the application, along with a logical topology of the communication and storage aspects

# How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  Understanding and incorporating user needs into software design involves analyzing both business and technical requirements, gathering stakeholder feedback, and prioritizing user experience.  By focusing on usability, functionality, and meeting performance expectations, designers ensure that the software not only satisfies users but also performs effectively under diverse conditions.

# How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  In designing software, I approached it by first comprehensively analyzing requirements, focusing on user-centered design principles, and structuring robust system architectures.  Techniques included using design patterns, prioritizing performance and security considerations, and iterating through feedback loops.  In the future, I would enhance my approach by integrating agile methodologies, fostering cross-functional collaboration, and emphasizing continuous improvement to adapt designs effectively to evolving needs and technologies.
